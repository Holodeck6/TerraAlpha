## Chapter One

Isaac wiped sweat from his brow as he quickly reviewed the subroutine he had just entered into the program which managed the cataloging of the facility's experiments. If there were no mistakes, he would be able to override all of the security protocols with the press of a button. One error, however, would be enough to trigger the alarms and attract the attention of Security.

Isaac's earpiece crackled, then he heard Mike’s voice. "How are things going there?"

"I'm almost done," Isaac responded after pressing the button on his transmitter.

"The sooner the better," Mike hissed.

Isaac hit the commit button, then waited as the terminal screen went blank, a sign that the processor was rebooting. He let out a sigh of relief when the screen came back to life, first filled with the words "Alpha Omega," and then with a listing of all of the current experiments. His changes had bypassed the login screen, giving him automatic access.

He quickly searched for the experiment that they needed to access: #J1517. Finally, the serial number came up, followed by a three-dimensional schematic. Isaac dialed the experiment's address, and activated the transference bridge.

"I'm locked on," Isaac said into his comlink. “Get the shuttle into position.”

"Engines are warmed up. I'm entering the launch bay."

Isaac gathered his things, slid them into his backpack, and hurried out of the control room. The computer would only be able to maintain the bridge with #J15617 for a few minutes, but that was enough time for him and Mike to achieve what they needed to.

Isaac was on his way towards the staircase, when he heard footsteps behind him. He glanced backwards, and saw two security guards carrying rifles.

"Halt!" One demanded. “Identify yourself!”

But Isaac was already on his way down the stairs towards the launch bay.

Mike was waiting for him outside the shuttle's air lock.

"I was spotted," Isaac said.

"Don't worry, we’ll lose them once we’re across the bridge," Mike said as he lead Isaac to the shuttle’s cockpit. Mike took the controls, and Isaac sat behind him at a co-pilot’s station.
